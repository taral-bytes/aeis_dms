Installation of external js packages
-------------------------------------

All javascript was located in styles/bootstrap until SeedDMS 5.1.18 and 6.0.11.
Since 5.1.19 and 6.0.12 most of it has moved into the view at views/boostrap/vendors
and is no longer placed in git but must be installed by npm and grunt.

Run

`npm install`

and afterwards

`grunt`

to download the js packages and copy them into the new location.
