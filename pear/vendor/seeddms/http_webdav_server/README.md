SeedDMS WebDAV Server
=====================

This code is based on the the pear package Http/WebDav/Server which was
released ages ago but still works. Most software uses sabre/dav nowadays
and SeedDMS will use it as well, sooner or later. For now we stick with
this package. I was wrapped into composer package as part of the effort
to eliminate the last pear packages still use in SeedDMS. The original
PHP code has not changed at all.
